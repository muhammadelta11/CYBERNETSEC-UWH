# Secure Materi PDF Files

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Step 1: Update upload logic in app/Http/Controllers/admin/KelasController.php to use 'local' disk instead of 'public' for materi_files, storing relative paths in the 'url' field.
- [x] Step 2: Add downloadMateri method to app/Http/Controllers/front/KelasController.php to handle secure file serving with enrollment check (via UserKelas relation).
- [x] Step 3: Add new route in routes/web.php for secure download: GET /materi/{id}/download -> KelasController@downloadMateri with 'auth' middleware.
- [x] Step 4: Update resources/views/front/kelas/belajar.blade.php to use the secure route for document download links instead of direct asset().
- [x] Step 5: Provide and run a one-time migration command for existing files: Move from storage/app/public/materi_files to storage/app/materi_files and update DB 'url' fields to remove 'public/' prefix.
- [x] Step 6: Test the implementation: Verify direct access returns 404, enrolled users can download, non-enrolled get 403, and new uploads work securely.

## Testing Instructions:
1. **Direct Access Test**: Try accessing a materi file directly via URL (e.g., /storage/materi_files/filename.pdf) - should return 404.
2. **Enrolled User Test**: Login as a user enrolled in a course, go to the belajar page, click view - should open PDF inline in browser for viewing only.
3. **Non-Enrolled User Test**: Login as a user not enrolled in the course, try accessing the view URL - should return 403 Forbidden.
4. **Unauthenticated User Test**: Try accessing belajar page without login - should redirect to login page.
5. **New Upload Test**: Upload a new materi file through admin panel - should store in storage/app/materi_files and be accessible only via secure route for viewing.
